# Clicked Ads ML Classification Model üñ±Ô∏è
## Overview
This repository houses a machine learning classification model developed to evaluate the efficacy of an advertising campaign by analyzing historical advertising data. The goal is to identify patterns and insights that can inform marketing strategies, ultimately targeting the appropriate audience for the advertisement.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are as follows:

**1. Train Classification Model:**

Develop a machine learning model using historical advertising data to accurately classify potential customers, determining the appropriate target audience for the advertisement.

**2. Evaluate Advertising Campaign Performance:**

Assess the effectiveness of the advertising campaign by analyzing key business metrics, including Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Net Profit per Click.

**3. Assess Model Discrimination:**

Evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative instances by analyzing the Area Under ROC Curve (ROC AUC).

**4. Optimize Predictive Probabilities:**

Measure the accuracy of the predicted probabilities generated by the model using log loss.

## Metrics

**1. Business Metric:**

* **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** A crucial business metric representing the percentage of users who click on the ad after viewing it.

* **Net Profit per Click (RPC - CPC):** Calculated as the revenue per click minus the cost per click, providing insights into the profitability of each click.

**2. ML Model Metrics:**
* **Accuracy Score:** Represents the proportion of correctly classified instances among the total instances in the dataset. Higher accuracy scores indicate better overall model performance.
* **Area Under ROC Curve (ROC AUC):** Measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, useful for binary classification. A higher ROC AUC indicates better model discrimination.
* **Loss (Log Loss):** Measures the accuracy of the predicted probabilities. Lower log loss values are desirable.

## Web Application

A Streamlit web application has been built to showcase the classification model's functionality. [Click here to access the web application.](https://clickedadspredictionmlclassificationmodel-deswydmhfansqj7kmzrm.streamlit.app/)

Feel free to explore the code, model performance metrics, and the Streamlit app to gain insights into the effectiveness of the advertising campaign and the accuracy of the classification model.
